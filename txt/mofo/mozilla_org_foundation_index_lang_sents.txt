The Mozilla Foundation
The nonprofit Mozilla Foundation believes the Internet must always remain a global public resource that is open and accessible to all. Our work is guided by the Mozilla Manifesto.
The direct work of the Mozilla Foundation focuses on fueling the movement for an open Internet. We do this by connecting open Internet leaders with each other and by mobilizing grassroots activists around the world.
The Foundation is also the sole shareholder in the Mozilla Corporation, the maker of Firefox and other open source tools. Mozilla Corporation functions as a self-sustaining social enterprise – money earned through its products is reinvested into the organization.

Foundation Programs
Working with people and communities all across Mozilla, the Foundation team is focused on fueling the open Internet movement. Our programs are focused in three areas:
Shape the agenda
Mozilla has identified five key issues that are critical to build the open Internet we want:
Privacy and Security
Open Innovation
Decentralization
Web Literacy
Digital Inclusion
Connect leaders
Our nascent Mozilla Leadership Network finds, connects and provides learning opportunities for a new generation of leaders who will ensure the next wave of access, inclusion and opportunity online.
Rally citizens
Mozilla works with allies to cultivate a global force of tens of millions of people prepared to support the rights of citizens of the web.
Products and Technology
Mozilla Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Foundation, makes consumer Internet products that advance the same values outlined in the Mozilla Manifesto.
Firefox, our flagship product, gives increased choice, privacy and security to 100s of millions of people around the world. Product exploration initiatives like our ‘connected devices’ program aim to bring more mainstream products with Mozilla values into the world. Technology initiatives like Rust and Mozilla’s online game centre aim to spread new thinking about open technology across the whole of the Internet industry.
Mozilla Community
The real power behind Mozilla is a global community of 10,000s of volunteers, allies and partners. Members of the Mozilla community participate by doing everything from contributing code to Firefox and teaching digital literacy to translating our software, organizing advocacy campaigns and writing the world's most referenced web developer site.
