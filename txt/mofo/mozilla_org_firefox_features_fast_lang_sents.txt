Get more done. Browse faster and lighter with multiple tabs
Our new, powerful multi-process platform handles all your tabs without slowing down your computer.
Firefox is now faster and leaner
We’ve been working out, so you can get more done.
Use less memory
No one likes a computer hog! Firefox is a lean, mean (actually we’re pretty nice) browsing machine. Since we use less RAM than Chrome, your other programs can keep running at top speed.
Get all the tabs without lags
Multi-tasking with multiple tabs just got easier. Firefox is now a multi-process browser, which means that your tabs stay fresh and won’t take forever to reload. With 86% less hang time, switch quickly between tabs even as you open more.
Level-up browser gameplay
We led the tech to run 3D games at near-native speeds, and now Firefox is bringing better performance to online gaming. Our powerful browser reduces lags, speeds up ping times and optimizes overall gameplay through faster, leaner browsing.
