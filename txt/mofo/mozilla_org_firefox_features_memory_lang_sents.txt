Firefox Browser: Use less memory, get more speed
Is your computer slow? Your browser might be using too much memory. Switch to Firefox today for more speed.
Less memory usage than Chrome
If your web browser uses too much memory, switch to Firefox.
Speed up your computer
Every computer program you run takes up some memory. When too much is used, your system can slooooowww down. Firefox aims for a balance — using enough memory to let you browse smoothly and leaving plenty of memory to keep your computer responsive.
Stop running out of memory
Chrome uses up to 1.77x more memory than Firefox. If your computer is already low on memory, this can cause a significant slowdown. Using Firefox’s latest version with multi-process can result in more available memory to run your favorite programs.
Browse faster, privately
Explore the web faster with Firefox Private Browsing. Only Firefox’s private mode includes tracking protection which blocks ads with trackers from loading on pages. Decluttering sites means web pages can load faster.
