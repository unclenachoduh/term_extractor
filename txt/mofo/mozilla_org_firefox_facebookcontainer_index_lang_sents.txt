Facebook can track almost all your web activity and tie it to your Facebook identity. If that’s too much for you, the Facebook Container extension isolates your identity into a separate container tab, making it harder for Facebook to track you on the web outside of Facebook.
Install and contain
Installing the extension is easy and, once activated, will open Facebook in a blue tab each time you use it. Use and enjoy Facebook normally. Facebook will still be able to send you advertising and recommendations on their site, but it will be much harder for Facebook to use your activity collected off Facebook to send you ads and other targeted messages.
About Firefox and Mozilla
We’re backed by Mozilla, the not-for-profit organization that puts people over profit to give everyone more power online. We created this extension because we believe that you should have easy-to-use tools that help you manage your privacy and security.
