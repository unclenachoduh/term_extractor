Data Privacy Principles
Mozilla is an open source project with a mission to improve your Internet experience. This is a driving force behind our privacy practices.
Back to Mozilla Privacy Policy
The following five principles stem from the Mozilla Manifesto and inform how we:
develop our products and services
manage user data we collect
select and interact with partners
shape our public policy and advocacy work
No surprises
Use and share information in a way that is transparent and benefits the user.
User control
Develop products and advocate for best practices that put users in control of their data and online experiences.
Limited data
Collect what we need, de-identify where we can and delete when no longer necessary.
Sensible settings
Design for a thoughtful balance of safety and user experience.
Defense in depth
Maintain multi-layered security controls and practices, many of which are publicly verifiable.
