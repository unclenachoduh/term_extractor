You’ve just been upgraded to Firefox Nightly %(version)s!
Firefox Nightly
Your Firefox Nightly has been updated.
Every 6 to 8 weeks, a new major version of Firefox is released and as a result, the Nightly version increases as well.
This is a good time to thank you for helping us make Firefox better and to give you some pointers to documentation, communication channels and news sites related to Nightly that may be of interest to you.
If you want to know what’s happening around Nightly and its community, reading our blog and following us on Twitter are good starting points!
Want to know which platform features you could test on Nightly and can’t see yet on other Firefox channels? Then have a look at the Experimental Features page on MDN.
Do you experience crashes? Unexpected behavior? Web compatibility regressions? We’d love to get them filed in Bugzilla to make sure they don’t make it to the final release (extra karma if you add the nightly-community keyword to your bug reports)!
Would you be willing to help us triage unconfirmed bugs in Bugzilla? Then maybe TriageBot could be of interest to you.
You can also interact with the Nightly community on IRC in the #nightly channel. Feel free to ask questions and talk about features, regressions or crashes you may be experiencing.
Go community!
